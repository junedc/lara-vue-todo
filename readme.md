source https://github.com/selloutdesign/laravel-vue-task-app


This is a working fork of http://felicianoprochera.com/simple-task-app-with-laravel-5-3-and-vuejs/ - There were several depreciated call and methods. 

The biggest gotcha's that I ran acrossed.
<ul>
    <li>If you are using MAMP for your Database include DB_SOCKET='/Applications/MAMP/tmp/mysql/mysql.sock' in your .env file</li>
    <li>Using Axios - The second arguement in the POST, PATCH call must be an object. I was runnign into errors trying to pass self.task - Using Object.assign({}, self.task) fixed the issue.</li>
    <li>Moved the model logic to it's own Controller using 'php artisan make:controller App/TaskController --resource' added 'use DB' and 'use App\Task' to it</li>
    <li>Used Eloquent for all the Task CRUD operations</li>
    <li>Laravel will throw a 500 error if the Eloquent operations fail. Looking for the best way to debugged this.</li>
    <li>In the Tasks.vue updated a couple depreciated calls - using mounted(), added a div tag to encapsulate the template, and pointed the app.js Vue Element at #app. </li>
</ul>

Will update soon with Auth - Passport JWT.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation give you tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
